Open-source applications that I am running in my homeserver.

Current setup:
Raspberry Pi 5 8GB
Active Cooler for Raspberry Pi 5
256GB SSD

I normally run these applications beforehand & get to know them, 
before feeding my mostly manually created YAMLs & configurations for AI
to go through, and give me feedback with possible improvements.

My goal is to run these applications as minimalistic as possible.
Hopefully, without sacrificing on security.

Anyway, they're all here for use as I don't think the Internet is yet clogged full of K8s tutorials.

If one person finds them useful, I believe it has all been worth it.

### Applications & goals ###
    I normally run these applications beforehand & get to know them, 
    before feeding my mostly manually created YAMLs & configurations for AI
    to go through, and give me feedback with possible improvements.

    My goal is to run these applications as minimalistic as possible.
    Hopefully, without sacrificing on security.
    Perhaps learning along the way.

    Anyway, they're all here for use as I don't think the Internet is yet clogged full of K8s tutorials.

    If one person finds them useful, I believe it has all been worth it.
